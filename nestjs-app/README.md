This simple NestJS app was created by following https://docs.nestjs.com/first-steps (and in particular, by running `nest new nestjs-app`). To run the app, do the following from within the `nestjs-app` directory:

```bash
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

You should then be able to connect to the server by navigating to http://localhost:3000 in a browser.
